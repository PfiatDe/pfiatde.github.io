## Why badoption.eu?
KDC_ERR_BADOPTION (13).
In reference to one of the most famous and not very helpful Kerberos failure, this site should help a little bit to keep an overview about things going on in IT-Sec.

## What to expect here
a) Blogposts about stuff I found interesting
[https://badoption.eu/blogs](https://badoption.eu/blogs).

b) ITSLOG : IT-Security Miniblogs, to keep track of new stuff
[https://badoption.eu/itslog](https://badoption.eu/itslog).

c) A search engine specifically for IT-Security relevant stuff (Work-in-Progress)
